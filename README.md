Dice Games
==========

This is a collection of well-know dice games written in C# (compatible with .NET 2.0).

Interfaces and rules are in Italian language, since I'm too lazy to translate all
that stuff into English at this time; however, all the games are well documented
over the Internet and in Wikipedia.

GPL v2 governs all the source code, as usual.

Following games are provided:

* Yahtzee family
    * Yahtzee
    * Yatzy
    * Maxi Yatzy
    * Yacht
    * Triple Yahtzee
    * Power Yahtzee

* Others
